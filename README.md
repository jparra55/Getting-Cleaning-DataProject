# Getting-Cleaning-DataProject

This repository includes all the files required by the course project of the third course of the data science program.

If you want a description of all the steps performed in my solution to the project, you can see the codebook file, that also includes a description of the names that were given to the variables of the associated dataset.

The script submitted also contains the steps performed, and a brief description of each one, so you can understand all the process I've made. You can load the script normally with the source () function in R.

Finally I will like to apologize if you find that my use of the language is not aproppiated, this is not my primary language and I have yet much more to learn, and thank you for taking the time to read this, it's very important for me. Cordially, Jhon Parra.
